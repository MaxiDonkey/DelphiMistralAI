unit MistralAI.Async.Support;

{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Unit containing  records for managing  asynchronous events related to
      chat requests.

      The  MistralAI.Chat.AsyncEvents  unit  provides  definitions for  the
      TAsyncParams<T>  and  TAsynStreamParams<T>  records, which  are  used
      to  handle  the lifecycle  of asynchronous chat operations, including
      starting, progressing, succeeding, and handling errors.
      These records enable non-blocking operations for chat functionalities
      and can be reused across multiple modules.

      This unit depends  on MistralAI.Params.Core  for parameter management.
      The IUseParams<T>  and  TUseParamsFactory<T>  interfaces  and  classes
      from  MistralAI.Params.Core  are  utilized  to  create  and manage the
      parameter  instances  for  asynchronous  operations.
